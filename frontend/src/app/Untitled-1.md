I have reviewed both the websites https://www.pricerunner.com/ and https://www.prisjakt.nu. Also, thanks for sharing the attached document, it really helps me completely understand your requirements.



I have already develop similar websites in the past, let me share you my BEST work samples:

I clearly understand your requirements and the proposed website will incorporate key features such as:

Real-Time Price Comparison: Users can compare prices from multiple retailers side by side.
Price History Tracking: A feature that allows users to view historical price data over selected time frames.
User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive design that facilitates easy navigation and product searches.
Advanced Filtering Options: Users can refine their searches based on various criteria including price range, brand, and product specifications.
User Accounts: Registered users can save their favorite products, set price alerts, and access personalized recommendations.

Looking forward for the opportunity to discuss this project further.
